Discord Markdown Spec:

begin/end tags:
 italic _
 italic *
 bold **
 underline __

search for longest tag


/spoiler is the same as just putting everything in || â€¦ ||

inside of spans cannot be empty (makes sense)
if that is the case, then it is treated as regular text
which means that: "****" is not <text>****</text> but instead: <italic>**</italic>
it *would* be bold, but there is no text between the bold tag, so the italic tag rule

inline code (monospace) is either 1 or 2 backticks
code blocks are 3 backticks

no nested quote blocks


lists:
 level 2 list requires at least one space at the beginning of the line
 level 3 list requires a level 2 sublist before AND at least 3 spaces!
 level N list (where N is > 2 and < 10) requires level N-1 before it AND at LEAST 1 + ((N - 2) * 2) spaces at the beginning of the line
 goes up to level 10
 a list item REQUIRES text


lists cannot contain quote blocks
