currently implemented like so:

	Poll by @user:
	> description
	option1: voteCount1
	option2: voteCount2
	optionN: voteCountN
	[ options dropdown ]
	[ close button ]


change it to something like this?:

	Poll by @user:
	> description
	option1: voteCount1
	option2: voteCount2
	optionN: voteCountN
	[ vote button ]

pressing on button opens modal:

	Select vote:
	[ options dropdown ]
	[ confirm button ] [ close poll button ] [ exit button ]

pre-select option that user has voted on.
the close poll button would only be present to those that are allowed to close that particular poll
(i.e.: the creator of the poll and admins)


----

/poll

-> modal:

	Description
	+-----------------+
	| text field      |
	|                 |
	+-----------------+

	Options (separate by newlines)
	+-----------------+
	| text field      |
	|                 |
	+-----------------+

	[ open button ]  [ cancel button ]

(are checkboxes a thing? allow anonymous vs non-anonymous polls?)
