currently implemented like so:

	Poll by @user:
	> description
	option1: voteCount1
	option2: voteCount2
	optionN: voteCountN
	[ options dropdown ]
	[ close button ]


change it to something like this?:

	Poll by @user:
	> description
	option1: voteCount1
	option2: voteCount2
	optionN: voteCountN
	[ vote button ]

pressing on button sends ephemeral message:

	Select vote:
	[ options dropdown ]
	[ confirm button ] [ close poll button ]

pre-select option that user has voted on.
the close poll button would only be present to those that are allowed to close that particular poll
(i.e.: the creator of the poll and admins)

pressing either buttons would remove the message.

TODO: check if this is actually possible

/poll

-> modal:

	Description
	+-----------------+
	| text field      |
	|                 |
	+-----------------+

	Options (separate by newlines)
	+-----------------+
	| text field      |
	|                 |
	+-----------------+

	[ open button ]  [ cancel button ]

(are checkboxes a thing? allow anonymous vs non-anonymous polls?)



user group permissions:
	polls.openNew
		allows creating and opening new polls

	polls.closeAny
		allows closing any polls
