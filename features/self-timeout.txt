current self-timeout duration function:
	f(x) = 5 * 1.25^x

once past mega timeout duration => change to linear function?

add a per-member cooldown after the timeout runs out
10% of what the timeout was (e.g.: 1h timeout results in a 6min cooldown after the timeout is done)
discard cooldown if it's less than 15 seconds

maybe cooldown should be "reverse"-exponential function? ("reverse" because it starts fast and ends slow (idk what that is called))

if a member tries to do the self-timeout while cooldown is active, only tell him the approximate cooldown time left.
round up to the next highest unit?:
* in total less than hour left => tell member that approximately an hour is left
* in total less than minute left => tell member that approximately a minute is left
or maybe it should be half-unit:
* in total less than minute left (but more than 0.5 minutes) => tell member that approximately a minute is left
* in total less than 0.5 minutes left => tell member that approximately half a minute is left
(same with hour)
