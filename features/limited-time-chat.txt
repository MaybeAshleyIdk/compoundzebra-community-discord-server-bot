feature name: "Limited-Time Chat"

set up a channel, hereby referred to as the "limited-time chat channel"

initial start: the limited-time chat role is given to a fixed-amount (like 6?) of random guild members

every few hours (around 4-8?) 30% (rounded up) of the members with the limited-time chat role will get that role removed
and OTHER members (as many as it takes to go back up to the fixed-amount) that before DIDN'T have the role are given it instead
