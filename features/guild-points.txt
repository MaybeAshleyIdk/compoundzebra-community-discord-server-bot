feature name: "Guild Points"

point sources:
	* being member of the guild (over time income)
	* writing a non-trivial, non-spam-y message
	* predictions
	* duels
	* having your meme upvoted in the channel #memes
	* participation of guild events (doesn't have to be included as much in point-rate calculations) (would happen ~every two months)

avg / day: ~50 messages

first thing i need to do is figure out how much points one member would be getting over a certain period of time,
(with all sources, sans the guild events, included in the calculation) then i can pick a baseline, mid-price redemption
and go from there

redemptions:
	* time-out someone else for a minute (very high price)
	* add custom response command (high price)
	* changing OTHER members nickname (high price)
		* mid price for bot?
	* protect against other's changing your own nickname (mid price)
	* pin message (mid price)
	* vanity roles (low price)
	* changing own nickname (very low price)

time out should be available ~every two months
adding custom response command should be available ~every two months
changing OTHER nickname should be available ~every month
pin message should be available ~every two weeks
vanity role change should be available ~every two weeks (color change)
nickname change should be available ~every three days
