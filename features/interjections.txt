feature name: "Interjections" (formerly "Conditional Messages")

trying to look for patterns in a message, and then "interjects" with some message
(TODO: rename this feature? "interjections" sounds kinda… dumb and weird ngl, but it's very fitting so idk)


possible to opt-out:
	( ) User
	    real

	( ) Bot

	( ) User
	    ffs stupid bot
	 .-> ( ) Bot  fake

	 .-> ( ) User  !optout
