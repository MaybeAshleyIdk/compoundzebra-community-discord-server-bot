feature name: "Subscribed Keywords"

inspired by bttv highlighted keywords

member A can subscribe to keywords (or matching patterns)

if a member other then member A uses that keyword (or the pattern matches) in a message, notify member A (in private dms)
would need to work out things that it doesn't get too spammy:
* debounce the private message for a minute?
  i.e.: wait for a minute before sending private message, if while in that time another keyword is found, reset the one minute waiting period
        after the minute runs out, THEN send the message
* if member A has written a message 5 minutes prior to other member using keyword, ignore that

/subscribe <keyword>
/subscribe --regex <regex>
/subscribe --dcmm <dcmm>
