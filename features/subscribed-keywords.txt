feature name: "Subscribed Keywords"

inspired by bttv highlighted keywords

member A can subscribe to keywords (or matching patterns)

if a member other then member A uses that keyword (or the pattern matches) in a message, notify member A (in private dms)
would need to work out things that it doesn't get too spammy:
* debounce the private message for a minute?
  i.e.: wait for a minute before sending private message, if while in that time another keyword is found, reset the one minute waiting period
        after the minute runs out, THEN send the message
* if member A has written a message 5 minutes prior to other member using keyword, ignore that

/subscribe <keyword>
/subscribe --regex <regex>
/subscribe --dcmm <dcmm>

do that with context actions (or whatever it's called) and modals? (right clicking on the bot » Apps » Manage Subscribed Keywords)

whatever we're gonna go with, DON'T do it via custom (guild) commands, because that is public for other members to see
we could do it with custom commands in dms. would need to system to separate private channel- and guild commands
