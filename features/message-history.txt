/history show-channel <Channel> <beginDateTime: String> <endDateTime: String>
/history show-user <User> <beginDateTime: String> <endDateTime: String>
/history search-user-message <User> <query: String>

maybe change it to a modal?
wouldn't need separate subcommands, simply have fields for channel, user, begin datetime, end datetime and query


if begin datetime is only a date, without time, then turn it into a datetime ourselves:
change the given date to the day before at the time 10:00

datetime args can also use the special string "now"

if begin is after end, silently swap them


after using the command, the bot will collect the messages and send the result in dms to the user that executed
the command


use a dynamic thread pool for these operations (maybe even a thread pool per-operation?)
max threads is 3
very unlikely that more moderators are gonna use it at the same time
