feature name: "User Groups"

pretty self-explanatory: allows to define groups of different users.
users can be selected either by user snowflake ID or by role snowflake ID to select all in that role

other features of the bot can then use user groups

for example, only a certain group would be allowed to add new simple-response commands



raw syntax is basically the same as the include/exclude everyone/role/user/userGroup syntax of the command



=== command ===

usage: userGroups list

   or: userGroups show ( <name: String> | <id: String> )

   or: userGroups add <name: String>

   or: userGroups rename ( <oldName: String> | <id: String> ) <newName: String>

   or: userGroups edit ( <name: String> | <id: String> ) [remove] include everyone
   or: userGroups edit ( <name: String> | <id: String> ) [remove] include role <role: Role>
   or: userGroups edit ( <name: String> | <id: String> ) [remove] include user <user: User>
   or: userGroups edit ( <name: String> | <id: String> ) [remove] exclude role <role: Role>
   or: userGroups edit ( <name: String> | <id: String> ) [remove] exclude user <user: User>
   or: userGroups edit ( <name: String> | <id: String> ) [remove] includedIn ( <name: String> | <id: String> )
   or: userGroups edit ( <name: String> | <id: String> ) raw ( get | set )

   or: userGroups remove ( <name: String> | <id: String> )



examples:

< !userGroups list
> No user groups have been added yet


< !userGroups add "Plebs"
> New (empty) user group _"Plebs"_ (internal ID: `[id]`) has been added

< !userGroups add "plebs"
> A user group with the name _"Plebs"_ (internal ID: `[id]`) exists already

< !userGroups edit "plebs" include everyone

< !userGroups list
> * _"Plebs"_ (internal ID: `[id]`)

< !userGroups show "Plebs"
> The user group _"Plebs"_ (internal ID: `[id]`) contains the following rules:
> * @everyone is included
> (the full list of members is too big to display)
(allow_mentions would be off for this message)


< !userGroups add "admin"
> New (empty) user group _"admin"_ (internal ID: `[id]`) has been added

< !userGroups rename "admin" "Admins"
> User group _"admin"_ (internal ID: `[id]`) was renamed to _"Admins"_

< !userGroups show "admins"
> The user group _"Admins"_ (internal ID: `[id]`) contains no rules

< !userGroups edit "admins" raw set
  ```
  include role 00000000000000
  ```
