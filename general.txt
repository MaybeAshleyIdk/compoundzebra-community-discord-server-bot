time conversion:
	any message with time in it (formats either '<num> am', '<num> pm' or '<num>:<num>') and a ping to the bot.
	bot will then check the author's timezone (either do that with roles or via an internal state that each user can configure)
	and send a message '<t:...:F> / <t:...:R>'

	/\b[0-9]+(\s*:\s*[0-9]+)?\s*[ap]\s*m\b/i
	/\b[0-9]+\s*:\s*[0-9]+\b/i

	fun makeTimeReplyMessageString(match: String, timestamp: Instant) {
		val unixSeconds: Long = instant.epochSecond
		return "<t:$unixSeconds:F> | <t:$unixSeconds:R> (detected from the time \"`$match`\")"
	}

measurements conversion:
	somebody uses <num>'<num>(")? and the bot will respond with it converted to the metric system, and vice-versa


tone indicator explanation



random chance 1 in 100 0000 that the bot replies to a message: "WAS THAT THE BITE OF '87?!?" with that pic of mark
put in a filter of some sensitive words and don't reply to those
