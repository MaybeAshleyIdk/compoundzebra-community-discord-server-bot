DCMM - Discord Markdown (Pattern) Matching

* case-insensitive by default
* any whitespace in the pattern matches any whitespace in the text (e.g.: one space in pattern matches multiple spaces)
* whitespace also matches certain punctuation characters
* vowels (a, e, i, o & u) automatically match multiple consecutive times (e.g.: pattern /a/ matches multiple a's)
  (should this be for ALL letters?)
* certain letters match certain others that look similar (e.g.: letter 'O' also matches zero)

->
regex/^\s*[hH][eE3]+[lL1I]{2}[oO0]+(\s+|\s*,+\s*)[bB][oO0]+[tT]\s*$/

tokens:
	one or more letters next to each other -> word
	one or more whitespace characters -> whitespace
	three consecutive dots "..." -> matches anything. similar to regex's .*
		a pattern of /... words .../ is like regex /words/
	singular dot/period -> matches any punctuation characters or newlines
