language strings file format:

generally simple key-value list



simple format:
* no quotation marks
* whitespace is trimmed (excluding newlines)
* no escape sequences
* terminated by newline or EOF

```
invalidCommandName = Invalid Command
```


advanced format:
* must be surrounded by quotation marks
* whitespace is NOT trimmed
* escape sequences are supported

```
someString = "this is a string
with newlines and stuff"
```


groups?
* all entries in the group are prefixed with "${groupName}."
probably not really necessary

```
commands (
	pollCreation (
		invalidSomething = blah blah blah
	)

	shutdown (
	)
)
```
