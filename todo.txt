* storage

* with the sqlite jdbc, the jar will have a size of of ~30MB (!!! this is a lot !!!)

* [internal/codebase] qualifier for the config file path

* [public] command for adding response commands

* [public] help command

* [public] mod command to say something as the bot
* [public] mod command to replace a message of the bot
* [public] mod command to delete a message of the bot

* [public] temperature conversion command
	!tempconv

	Examples:
		* > !tempconv 0
		  < No temperature unit given
		* > !tempconv 0°C
		  < 0°C = 32°F = 237.15K
		* > !tempconv 20f -> °c
		  < 2°C = -6.67°C

* [public] currency conversion command
	!currencyconv
	!moneyconv
	use the GNU units that are already on the system for that
	(need to write at GNU units file parser for that)
