custom commands: !foo
slash commands: /foo

both have their ups and downs, but slash command provide auto complete and allow for modals, which is super helpful and
we also don't need to implement argument parsing with different argument types and whatnot ourselves

big downside for slash commands is no support varargs or other rest-type argument types, tough only like two commands
need it atm.
those two being poll creation and send message as bot and for the poll one we want to replace it with
a slash-command + modal anyway because varargs are hard to understand for users lmao
the second one can also be easily replaced with writing the message first and then just referencing it via
the message's id

so ig it's time to migrate all custom commands to slash commands.

tho what about response commands? i kinda wanna keep them as custom commands, in part because they are supposed to be
a guild point redemption at some point so there could be a few of them and that would clutter up the slash command
autocompletion
